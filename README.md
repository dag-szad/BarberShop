# Website for another non-existent company

This project is a simple HTML-based website for a barber shop. While the HTML itself was straightforward, the real learning experience came from getting acquainted with Tailwind CSS. Most of my time was spent adjusting to this new workflow, which was a significant shift from my usual methods.

Additionally, this project marks the first time I have incorporated TypeScript into my work. This added an extra layer of complexity and learning, but ultimately, it was a rewarding challenge. 🚀
